Audio and Video Recordings Aboard c-base
----------------------------------------

We are happy to hear you are interested in recording at c-base. However,
video and photo shoots are a sensitive matter and do require approval under 
all circumstances.

Application for Approval
------------------------

The c-base circle must approve your request. 
The circle is a democratic board that gathers every 1st and 14th day the a month. 
Meetings start at around 8pm.
Your desired date of recording can therefore only be after the next upcoming circle
event. Please send your request in advance via email to circle@c-base.org and
show up in person for the next circle event to introduce yourself and your
project. Your request should contain a brief project description,
your prefered date of recording, license and exploitation right as well
as an offer for a rental fee.

For approval we require that:

  - c-base receives a free full copy of the raw footage for our archives
  - you place a security deposit at c-base cashier which we will use 
    to cover for damage or repairs if applicable. The deposit will be
    released after receiving the full copy of the raw footage.
  - you personally convince the circle of your project. The circle
    declines applications if they do not serve the purpose of our
    association or if they simply don't see a fit.

An approval of your application does not acquit you from your duty of
asking every single individual for permission to record them!

The board of directors of c-base has the right to veto all circle
decisions, which is rarely exercised.

Location
--------

c-base consists of two decks. The upper deck is open to the public.
Upcoming recording sessions must be signposted distinctly. The lower
deck is closed to the public and reserved for the members of c-base.
Explicit approval is required to be allowed to record in this area.

Fee
---

The circle will very likely ask you for a fee - in addition to the
security deposit. This counts especially for commercial projects. These are some
reference points to help you forsee the outcome of the
circle decision:

  - Recording of an interview of a non-commercial or non-profit
    organization in combination with a CreativeCommons licensing:
    - free of charge
  - Recording of an interview for a TV station or a major internet
    news portal with all exploitational rights of the footage bound to
    that company and the right to resell the footageto third parties.
    Total time of your time recording at c-base is less than 2 hours
    and occures only on the upper public deck:
    - between 300 and 600 Euros
  - Recording of scenes for a TV show by a production firm
    with all exploitational rights bound to a commercial institution.
    Two entire days of recording on both decks of c-base:
    - between 3000 and 5000 Euros
  - Photo shooting, e.g. for an article or interview of an
    over-regional news magazine with all exploitational rights bound
    to a publisher or the author himself, no public-domain or
    CreativeCommons licensing and a total time of recording less than
    half a day:
    - between 100 and 300 Euros

Under certain circumstances it is possible to exclusively rent the
entire location. However, this does require an adequatly advanced
notice. c-base members always have unlimited access to c-base.
